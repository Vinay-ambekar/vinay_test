/*
In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods.
Think of it as a template or a recipe that defines how an object should be created. An object,
on the other hand, is an instance of a class.It's like a cake made from a recipe - the cake is the
object, and the recipe is the class.
