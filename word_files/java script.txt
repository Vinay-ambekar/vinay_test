**Question 3:** What are the advantages of using **getter** and **setter** method in OOP?

**Question 4:** You have OOP code below. And there is **single** error in this code? Your task is to **remove that error**.

**Important Note**: To solve this error You need to know about **method chaining** concept.

class Car {
  constructor(id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
  setMake(make) {
    this.make = make;
  }
  setModel(model) {

    return {
      id: this.id,
      make: this.make,
      model: this.model,
      fuelType: this.fuelType,
